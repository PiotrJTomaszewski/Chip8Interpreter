# Chip 8 Interpreter / Emulator

My first venture into the world of emulators.

Originally written in C with GUI created in Curses - this version is still available in the 'old' branch.

Later ported to C++ with GUI created in ImGui.

## Compilation and running

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/PiotrJTomaszewski/Chip8Interpreter.git
cd Chip8Interpreter
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make
./Chip8
```
